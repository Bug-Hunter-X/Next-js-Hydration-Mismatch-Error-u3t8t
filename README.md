# Next.js Hydration Mismatch Bug

This repository demonstrates a common hydration mismatch error in Next.js applications.  The error occurs because the client-side JavaScript attempts to manipulate the DOM in a way that differs from the server-side rendering.

## Bug Description

The `about.js` file attempts to access and modify the DOM element with the ID 'message' directly within the component's function.  This action occurs after the component has rendered on the client-side, but before the server-rendered HTML (which the client is attempting to hydrate) has fully completed its rendering process.  This discrepancy in the DOM state leads to a hydration mismatch error.

## Solution

The solution is to avoid directly manipulating the DOM within the component's function. Instead use state management (like React's useState hook) to update the component's internal state, which will cause Next.js to re-render correctly.
